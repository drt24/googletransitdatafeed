README file for the transitfeed/misc directory


This directory contains a potpourri of code that has been written while hacking
on transitfeed but doesn't suitable for the main transitfeed distribution.
The software here may be totally useless, especially if you don't want to dive
into the source. The programs might not be tested and could be totally broken.
Of course, feedback is always welcome at googletransitdatafeed@googlegroups.com
If you complain about things in this directory please be prepared to help write
the fix.
