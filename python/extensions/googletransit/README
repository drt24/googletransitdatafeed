README file for the googletransit extension


This extension modifies the transitfeed package to adapt it to the requirements
and features specific to Google Transit.

List of changes to the default behavior:
* extensions.googletransit.Agency:
  - extension of transitfeed.Agency
  - adding pybcp47 module for supporting BCP-47 language code validation
* extensions.googletransit.FareAttribute:
  - extension of transitfeed.FareAttribute as in the open proposal
    "add agency_id column to fare_attributes.txt" at
    http://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-changes/browse_frm/thread/4e74c23bb1f80480
  - adds new field 'agency_id' and function ValidateAgencyId()
* extensions.googletransit.FeedInfo:
  - new class for validating feedinfo.txt as poposed in
    https://sites.google.com/site/gtfschanges/spec-changes-summary#feed_info
  - validates fields 'feed_publisher_name', 'feed_publisher_url', 'feed_lang',
    'feed_timezone', 'feed_valid_from' and 'feed_valid_until'
  - recognizes field 'feed_version'
  - The valid dates range specified by 'feed_valid_from' and 'feed_valid_until'
    is only used to check the feed validity. It's not used for other purposes.
    In particular, services and service exceptions are not dropped or reduced if
    they are defined outside this valid dates range.
* extensions.googletransit.Route
  - extension of transitfeed.Route as proposed in
    https://sites.google.com/site/gtfschanges/spec-changes-summary#routes and
    https://sites.google.com/site/gtfschanges/open-proposals
  - adding field 'co2_per_km' and ValidateCo2PerKm() function
  - adding HVT (Hierarchical Vehicle Type) route types, also used in
    extensions.googletransit.Stop for validating field vehicle_type.
    The HVT values are derived from the European TPEG standard, see discussion
    at http://groups.google.com/group/gtfs-changes/msg/ed917a69cf8c5bef
* extensions.googletransit.Schedule:
  - extension of transitfeed.Schedule for being able to validate
    interrelationships between the new fields and data sets introduced in this
    extension
  - new feed_info variable and AddFeedInfoObject() method in order to be able to
    register a extensions.googletransit.FeedInfo object in the Schedule
  - validates FeedInfo.feed_lang against Agency.agency_lang
  - validates FeedInfo.feed_timezone against Agency.agency_timezone
  - checks that all Agencies have the same timezone
  - overrides ValidateFeedStartAndExpirationDates() in order to take
    FeedInfo.feed_valid_from and FeedInfo.feed_valid_until into account
* extensions.googletransit.Stop
  - extension of transitfeed.Stop as proposed in
    https://sites.google.com/site/gtfschanges/spec-changes-summary#stops
  - adding and validating fields 'stop_timezone', 'vehicle_type' and
    'wheelchair_boarding'
